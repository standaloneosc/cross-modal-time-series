def adjust_learning_rate(optimizer, epoch, args, return_rate=False):
    """
    Adjust the learning rate during training based on the specified strategy.
    
    This function implements various learning rate adjustment strategies to improve
    training convergence and model performance. It supports multiple predefined
    strategies and can either modify the optimizer directly or return a rate
    multiplier for use with PyTorch Lightning.
    
    Args:
        optimizer (torch.optim.Optimizer): The optimizer whose learning rate will be adjusted.
        epoch (int): Current training epoch number.
        args (object): Arguments object containing learning rate configuration with attributes:
            - learning_rate (float): Initial learning rate

                                    Defaults to False.
